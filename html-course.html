        <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web. It provides the basic building blocks for creating websites and web applications, allowing developers to define the structure and layout of a webpage using a series of elements and tags.</p>
        
        <p>Some important HTML concepts include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Elements</strong> - Represent the different parts of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.</li>
            <li><strong>Attributes</strong> - Provide additional information about an element, such as its class, id, or source URL.</li>
            <li><strong>Forms</strong> - Allow users to input data and interact with a webpage, such as submitting a contact form or logging into an account.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>With HTML, you can create static web pages, build responsive layouts, embed multimedia content, and structure the content of your website in a semantically meaningful way. By mastering HTML, you can create well-organized and accessible web pages that provide a positive user experience for your visitors.</p>
