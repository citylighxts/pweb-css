        <h2>Introduction to CSS</h2>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to define the visual presentation of a web page. It allows developers to control the layout, appearance, and design of multiple web pages all at once by separating the content from the presentation.</p>
        
        <p>Some important CSS concepts include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Selectors</strong> - Used to target specific elements on a webpage and apply styles to them.</li>
            <li><strong>Properties</strong> - Define the appearance of elements, such as color, font size, and margin.</li>
            <li><strong>Classes and IDs</strong> - Allow for more specific targeting of elements and the application of unique styles.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>With CSS, you can create responsive layouts, customize the appearance of text and images, and enhance the overall look and feel of your website. By mastering CSS, you can create visually appealing and user-friendly web pages that engage and captivate your audience.</p>
