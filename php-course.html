        <h2>Introduction to PHP</h2>
        <p>PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language used to create dynamic web pages. It is embedded within HTML code and executed on the server to generate content that is sent to the client's browser.</p>
        
        <p>Some important PHP concepts include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Variables</strong> - Used to store data values that can be accessed and manipulated throughout the script.</li>
            <li><strong>Functions</strong> - Blocks of code that can be reused to perform specific tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Control Structures</strong> - Conditional statements and loops that control the flow of execution based on specified conditions.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>With PHP, you can create dynamic web applications, process form data, interact with databases, and perform a wide range of server-side tasks to enhance the functionality of your website.</p>
